**Loop invariant （循环不变量）**
- Initialization: It is true prior to first iteration of the loop.
- Maintenance: If it is true before an iteration of loop, it remains true before the next iteration.
- Termination: When the loop terminates, the invariant gives us a useful property that help show that the algorithm is correct.
